            "NEW DELHI: Legendary Kapil Dev on Tuesday lauded India's ten straight wins at the recently concluded World Cup but pointed out that excess hype surrounding an almost-certain third title was not needed.As Australia crushed over a billion dreams of India winning a third World Cup title, beating hosts handsomely by 6 wickets in the summit clash, Kapil conceded that the final day was not ours.The World Cup champion also said that fans should refrain from creating too much pressure on the players and treat cricket as just another sport.\"Don't keep so much hopes that people end up with broken hearts. We need to keep a balance. Other teams also came to India to compete in the World Cup. We shouldn't create so much hype. We need to look at sports as sports only. Whoever plays good on the day, we need to respect that. We are too emotional,\" Kapil said.India won 10 games, most of which were lopsided as contests, before Australia turned the tables on them at the Narendra Modi Stadium on November 19.For past 10 years, India have lost seven knock-out games out of eight ICC tournaments that they took part between 2014 to 2023. Kapil doesn't know if the pressure of occasion gets to them.\"I think today's players can answer how much pressure they feel. We can only feel,\" he said.However there are shortcomings which needs to be taken care of, Kapil stated, without specifying what they were.\"If they (India) win it feels really good. There are shortcomings which we need to address. It is not that you won't have shortcomings after a win. What's most important is to rectify them,\" the 63-year-old said.He urged fans to celebrate what India achieved rather than what they missed out.\"They (India) won 10 matches in a row. Is it not enough? We should look at other teams as well. We shouldn't compare anyone. What is important is to see whether they played good cricket or not. We played very good cricket. Final day was not ours so be it,\" the 1983- World Cup-winning captain added.Kapil cited the examples of South Africa and defending champions England to prove his point.\"We should look at performance of other teams as well like, South Africa, England who were the defending champions, they finished last (seventh).\"Kapil also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's gesture to visit the Indian dressing room and console the players after the final loss in Ahmedabad on November 19.\"If the Prime Minister doesn't encourage, who will? He is the No.1 man in the country and if he supports, it feels good,\" he said.The former all-rounder also refrained from commenting on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma 's future in T20 Internationals.\"This is selectors job and we should leave it to them. It is not good to comment on everything. They are responsible and what they feel good, they should do,\" he said.The second edition of the Kapil Dev Grant Thornton Invitational golf tournament, sanctioned by Proffesional Golf Tour of India, will have prize purse of Rs 2 crore this year, double the amount from last year.Title holder Varun Parikh will try to defend his title in the tournament beginning on Wednesday at the DLF Golf and Country Club here.Kapil said some former cricketers including Murali Karthik, Madan Lal, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh are expected to be present on the final day of the event on December 3.He also said he would request Sachin Tendulkar to grace the occasion.\"Already the prize money has been doubled. It feels good that some former cricketers will be coming for the event. Why can't cricketers play other sports?\"If we can support other sport apart from cricket, why not? In India, there is not just one game,\" said the man, who has been an amateur golfer since his retirement.\n",

But a BCCI official confirmed Dravid’s contract extension, at least for next year’s T20 World Cup to be held in USA-West Indies was ‘always on the cards, if the ODI World Cup went well’.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unlike England, which has separate head coaches and support staff for red-ball and white-ball cricket, the BCCI prefers to have a reputed coach to oversee all cricket. Besides, the prevailing sentiment in the board is that home coaches are better placed to deliver results. All of this made the decision to offer Dravid a chance to stay in charge, easier.\n",
            "\n",
            "Before arriving at the decision, views of top players and the Chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar were sought. Everyone wanted Dravid to guide the team in another attempt to take care of some unfinished business, after the semi-final defeat against England in the 2022 T20 World Cup.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I thank the BCCI for placing their trust in me, endorsing my vision. As we embrace new challenges post the World Cup, we remain committed to the pursuit of excellence,\" Dravid said in a statement.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the face of it, under Dravid, India lost key away Tests. They lost the 3-Test series in South Africa 1-2. The rescheduled Test in England was also lost. India’s qualification for the WTC final was largely on the strength of their home dominance and a series win in Bangladesh.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia, the Indian team mix as well as their cricket looked dated and unthreatening. When they were blanked by eventual champions England, it did not come as a surprise.\n",
            "\n",
            "To Dravid’s misfortune, the team was rarely able to play at full strength, with continuous injuries to key players. Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was dearly missed. Even captaincy continued to change hands for the same reason. It was after the South Africa series that Virat Kohli gave up Test captaincy. In one of those three Tests, he got injured and KL Rahul had to step in. Regular captain Rohit as well as vice-captain KL Rahul missed the decisive Test in England and Bumrah became the last-minute choice to lead.\n",
            "\n",
            "In fact, two months before the home ODI World Cup, there was no guarantee, if India’s middle-order would be at full strength. Dravid said it wasn’t for lack of planning, but simply because of injuries. “I could have told you 18 or 19 months ago, it was always going to be between Rahul, Rishabh and Shreyas (in the middle-order),” he would say. As India’s luck turned, it all came together in the World Cup. Other than Pant, everyone including Bumrah returned fully fit.\n",
            "\n",
            "FUTURE PLANNING\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the last year, even captain Sharma, who struggled for fitness in the first half of Dravid’s coaching tenure, found the wherewithal to change his game completely. He knew the team needed him to step up, improve his strike-rate and that was a message that was clearly communicated by Dravid as well. Still, it was a risk but Rohit took it with an eye on the big picture.\n",
            "\n",
            "The gung-ho approach at the top was tried at the last T20 World Cup as well but it hadn't worked then, however it was hugely successful in ODIs. Can the 36-year-old take the same approach to the T20 World Cup? Will Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ruturaj Gaikwad be better? Surely, you can’t drop Shubman Gill. And what about Ishan Kishan? Does India’s T20 cricket require a batting anchor in Kohli? These are complex selection riddles which Dravid will have to sit with the selectors to resolve.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s one area – man management – where Dravid excels. His handling of dressing room matters, with grace and tact, has been acknowledged by the players. From creating space for a Kohli to prosper as a player after being a long-time captain, giving injured players deserving opportunities on return to giving a long run to those he saw match-winning potential in. Not every move may have come off, but most would agree, he was able to build the dressing room which had great atmosphere.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I am genuinely proud of the culture we have set in the dressing room. It's a culture that stands resilient, whether in moments of triumph or adversity,” said Dravid.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite IPL offers, it may also have been the purist in Dravid to have coaxed him to try and create history in South Africa – become the first Indian team to win a Test series there. India departs to South Africa for an all-format tour on December 6. It was under Dravid’s captaincy that India won its first ever Test match in 2006 on South African soil.\n",

            "Ex-cricketer Gautam Gambhir criticized India captain Rohit Sharma for his remarks on head coach Rahul Dravid, which he made during the national team's failed bid to win the 2023 Cricket World Cup earlier this month.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ahead of India's World Cup final against Australia, Rohit Sharma had said that the Men in Blue wanted to win the trophy for Rahul Dravid, who failed to lift it during his illustrious career.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rahul Dravid retired with over 10,000 and 13,000 runs in ODIs and Tests, respectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "“The way he stood by the players in difficult times, especially during the T20 World Cup, where we had a good run up until that semifinal, where we lost. How he reacted to certain situations and informed the players was helpful. He wants to be part of this big occasion, and it's for us to do it for him,” Rohit Sharma stated on the eve of the World Cup final against Australia.\n",
            "\n",
            "2011 World Cup winner Gautam Gambhir opined that the India skipper shouldn't have made those remarks as players win a trophy for the country and not for an individual.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "“Every player, every coach wants to win the World Cup. If he wants a renewal then definitely he should be given that chance. What better than continuity? I would never understand one thing. It happened during our time in 2011 too. When you say that you want to win the World Cup an individual, doesn't matter who that is… this statement is not right,” Gautam Gambhir told Sportskeeda. “You are trying to win the World Cup for the entire country. And if you want to say such a thing then don't say it in the media. Keep it within yourself. The truth is, it is more important to win a World Cup for the nation. I was asked the same in 2011 when everyone said we were trying to win the World Cup for one individual, I said no I want to win the Cup for my country. I picked up the bat for my country. So Rohit probably shouldn't have said this,” he added.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, Gautam Gambhir backed Rahul Dravid to stay as India coach, urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to renew his contract at the earliest.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rahul Dravid's assignment as the head coach of the Indian cricket team officially ended after the ODI World Cup. But Gautam Gambhir wished to see his tenure extended because the T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the US is only six months away.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "“But as far as Dravid's coaching credentials are concerned, he should be definitely given an extension if he wants to continue. I', very happy with his tenure. And not just for a year but at least two years because India will enter a rebuilding phase soon. You might not see Rohit Sharma, Bumrah and Shami in the next World Cup. So it's important to build towards the 50 over World Cup,” Gautam Gambhir explained. “Dravid's contract as head coach should be automatically renewed. The kind of cricket that India played throughout the World Cup, if you are going to judge a coach by just one match then it is a wrong precedent,” the hero of India's 2011 World Cup victory elaborated.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the 2023 Cricket World Cup final, Australian skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and chose to field first.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Indian team got off to a flying start, all thanks to Rohit Sharma's ultra-aggressive approach at the top of the order.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rohit Sharma smoked sixes and boundaries at will against Australia, taking the likes of Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc apart during his short but impressive knock of 47 off 31 balls.\n",
            "\n",
            "At 1/76 and Rohit Sharma firing on all cylinders, the crowd inside the Narendra Modi Stadium was excited as India looked in complete command of the proceedings on the field.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the Indians were running away with the match on the back of Rohit Sharma's explosive batting, a moment of brilliance turned the tide in Australia's favor.\n",
            "\n",
            "The head-turning moment came in the 10th over, bowled by Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell. After Rohit Sharma took him on, smashing a six and a four off Glenn Maxwell, the India captain tried to hit another maximum.\n",
            "\n",
            "But on this occasion, Rohit Sharma could only get an outside edge of the bat on the ball before Travis Head grabbed a brilliant catch, getting rid of Rohit Sharma for 47.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once Rohit Sharma perished, Australian bowlers tightened the screws on a dry Ahmedabad pitch, choking the flow of runs for the Indians.\n",
            "\n",
            "Except for Virat Kohli, who made 54 off 63 balls, no other Indian batter got going with boundaries becoming a rare commodity.\n",
            "\n",
            "KL Rahul did try to stem the tide in India's favor but continued to struggle throughout his knock of 66 off 107 balls, perhaps contributing to the home team's eventual score of 240 in their allocated 50 overs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chasing a paltry 240 to claim a record-extending sixth World Cup title, the Australians found themselves in a deep hole at 47/3 with Steve Smith, David Warner, and Mitch Marsh back in the hut.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, then came the match-winning 192-run partnership between Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne, with the former proving extremely dangerous as he took the match away from India's reach with a sensational 137 off 120 balls.\n",
            "\n",
            "Subsequently, Glenn Maxwell hit the World Cup-winning runs for Australia as the Kangaroos secured another victory in an ICC event, leaving India captain Rohit Sharma in tears and their millions of fans in a sea of sadness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pakistan legend Wasim Akram asked the fans, TV channels, and social media networks to accept their mistake of making India the World Champions ahead of the Rohit Sharma-led side's title clash against Australia.\n",
